CUDA execution flow
1. Allocate host memory and initialize host data (input data)
2. Allocate device memory
3. Transfer input data from host to device memory.
4. Execute kernels
5. Transfer output (result) from device memory to host memory.

cudaDeviceSynchronize(): tell CPU to wait until all threads in kernel are done before accessing results.
