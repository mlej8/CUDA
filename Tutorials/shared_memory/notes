## Why bother with threads if you can do the same thing using blocks?
Threads have mechanisms to:
1. Communicate between threads
2. Synchronize between threads. There is no way to synchronize blocks.

- Within a block, threads share data via shared memory
- Shared memory is extremely fast on-chip memory and user-managed
- Declare using `__shared__` and allocated per block.
- Data is not visible to threads in other blocks
